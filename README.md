# 🐄 TerekaID: Cardano-Powered Livestock Identity and Meat Traceability

TerekaID is a Cardano DApp that brings farm-to-slaughter transparency to Uganda’s meat supply chain — by assigning each animal a unique NFT, logging lifecycle events, and enabling anyone to verify origin via QR code.

> “From hoof to plate — every step logged, every buyer protected.”

---

## 🚩 What Problem Does TerekaID Solve?

Uganda's meat chain suffers from:

- 📝 Manual records that are easy to fake
- 🤷‍♂️ No proof of origin or quality
- 🦠 Poor disease control and recall systems
- 💸 Lost market value for honest smallholder farmers

Without verifiable data, trust breaks down across the value chain — from farmers to processors to consumers.

## ✅ How TerekaID Works

| Component            | Tech and Purpose                                                                 |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🆔 Livestock ID       | NFTs on Cardano (1 per animal) + CIP metadata                                  |
| 📦 Meat Traceability | QR code links to public history page backed by on-chain proofs                |
| 🐄 Lifecycle Logging  | Health, movement, breeding, slaughter events recorded via smart contracts     |
| 📱 Mobile App         | Farmer-friendly UI for low-bandwidth event logging                            |
| 🔍 Explorer           | Public trace page with timelines, batch search, and scan analytics            |
| 🧠 Off-chain Storage  | IPFS/Firebase for non-critical metadata (e.g. images, large text)              |
