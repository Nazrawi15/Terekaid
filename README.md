TerekaID is a Cardano-powered dApp for livestock and meat traceability in Uganda. Farmers register animals as NFTs, log health data, and certify meat from farm to fork. With QR traceability, smart contracts, and mobile-first access, TerekaID brings trust, safety, and transparency to the meat supply chain.
